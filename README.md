# nmRCGMSpython

Python scripts for Gatan Microscopy Suite, used at the University of Nottingham nmRC

Primarily scripts written for GMS 3.61, used with OneView and K3 detectors, on JEOL 2100Plus and 2100F microscopes.

Each script is standalone, but may require some additional standard python packages to be installed above the base GMS python installation (e.g. SciPy). Gatan advice is to use Pip to install additional packages as conda may change the numpy environment.
